This is a test file. #dev update

#Branching

git checkout -b <new branch name>          eg dev   to create new branch
git branch -a   			   check which branch we are at
git checkout <branch name> 	           switch to existing branch

after going on new branch creating new file, staging and committing & pushing it is the same as above
git push origin dev

Merging

git checkout main          1st go to the branch where we want our merged changes ie main here
git merge dev --no-ff      the additional “–no-ff” tells git we want to retain all of the commit messages prior to the merge. This will 					make tracking changes easier in the future
git push origin main       for the merge to show up on github
